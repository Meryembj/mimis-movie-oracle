# Mimi’s Movie Oracle 🎥🔮

A little magical project born from the eternal question: “What should I watch tonight?”

Powered by the universe, TMDB, and my own mystical algorithm, this app picks a random movie for you or lets you choose by genre and decade.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mimis-movie-oracle.git
   cd mimis-movie-oracle

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your TMDB API key:

   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

4. Start the development server:

   npm start

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see Mimi’s Movie Oracle in action.
